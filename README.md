# WonderCMS BS5 local inclusion plugin
### Author: Joaquim Homrighausen
(https://github.com/joho1968)

This is a simple plugin for [WonderCMS 3.x.x](https://www.wondercms.com/) that
includes Bootstrap 5 (5.3.2) as local assets from your site. The idea is that
other plugins and/or themes may then use BS5 without having to include it in
their distribution.

Once this plugin has been installed, you may, of course, use any Bootstrap 5
HTML in your own content too :blush:

From a [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)
point of view, it may possibly be a bad idea to include
[CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) delivered assets
on a website since
[CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) hosts can
technically fingerprint the visitor.

## Preview
There's no preview for this plugin as it only creates scripted (HTML) output.

## How to use
1. Login to your WonderCMS website.
2. Click "Settings" and click "Plugins".
3. Find plugin in the list and click "install".
4. Plugin will be automatically activated.
5. Your website now has all the powers of [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Changelog
